      <h1>PurdueEats</h1>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">PurdueEats is an Android app for students at Purdue University to explore off-campus dining options. I created this app with my team at Hello World 2018, Purdue's freshman-only 
        hackathon. This project was built in Android Studio, and was written in Java.</p>

      <h3>Problem Motivation</h3>
      <p>Purdue University has several mobile apps for on-campus dining options, such as dining courts and cafes. However, during my freshman fall semester, I struggled finding 
          off-campus dining options that suited my tastes. I wanted to create an app for students to find student-recommended restaurants and businesses so that they can 
          broaden their dining options, as well as support local businesses.

      <h3>App Features</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Search restaurants nearby Purdue's campus</li>
          <li>Provide information about dining options, including hours, menus, and location.</li>
          <li>Links to restaurant websites for users to get more details.</li>
      </ul>
